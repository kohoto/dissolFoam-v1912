This is the `OpenFoam(R)` solver for reactive transport with dissolution.

It solves for steady flow (Stokes or inertial) and reactant transport.

Mesh motion is controlled by the `normalMotionSlip` [libsFoamAux](https://github.com/vitst/libsFoamAux). Parameters to the boundary condition include the name of the field that drives the dissolution and the magnitude of the motion. Examples can be found in `dissolCases`.

Reaction boundary conditions (linear/nonlinear/danckwerts) are coded boundary conditions that are located in the case directory in `constant/bcInclude` (template files in `libsFoamAux/boundaryConditions`) The moving interface in `polyMesh/boundary` should go first.

This version was developed with OpenFOAM-v1912. Check out the latest [releases](https://github.com/vitst/dissolFoam/releases).

Additional documentation about the libraries, solver and cases can be found in the .zip attachment to the each release.
